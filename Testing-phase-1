	✓	Regeneron Phase 1 Mouse Study Protocol: Ultrasound-Enhanced Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) for Glioma Objective Test the efficacy and safety of intratumoral BPA delivery followed by focused ultrasound (FUS) and neutron irradiation in a GL261 orthotopic glioma mouse model, aiming to validate a 60-second treatment window for boron retention. Priority 1: Proof of Concept (Months 1-3) Study 1A: Boron Retention Kinetics - Groups : n=5 mice per timepoint - BPA alone (5 mg ¹⁰B) - BPA + FUS (60-sec delay) - BPA + FUS + microbubbles (1% v/v) - Sacrifice : 30s, 60s, 120s, 300s, 600s post-injection - Measurements : ICP-MS for ¹⁰B in tumor vs. normal brain; TUNEL assay for apoptosis - Hypothesis : FUS + microbubbles retain ≥60% boron at 60s in tumor vs. control Study 1B: Single-Modality Safety - Groups : n=8 each - BPA dose escalation: 1, 3, 5, 7 mg ¹⁰B - FUS alone: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 W/cm² - Neutron alone: 5×10⁸, 1×10⁹ n/cm²/s - Microbubbles alone (1% v/v) - Endpoints : Daily body weight, behavior, histopathology (liver, kidney, brain) - Go/No-Go : No >10% weight loss or Grade 3+ toxicity Priority 2: Combination Testing (Months 3-5) Study 2A: BPA + FUS (No Neutrons) - Model : GL261 orthotopic (C57BL/6) - Groups : n=10 each - Saline control - BPA only (5 mg) - FUS only (1 W/cm², 60s) - BPA + FUS (0-30s window) - BPA + FUS (60s window) - BPA + FUS (120s window) - Endpoints : Tumor volume (MRI every 7 days), boron retention (ICP-MS), cell death (TUNEL, caspase-3) - Go/No-Go : ≥30% boron retention improvement at 60s vs. BPA alone Study 2B: Full Triple Combination - Groups : n=12 each - Saline control - BPA + neutron (standard BNCT) - BPA + FUS + neutron (60s window) - BPA + FUS + neutron + microbubbles (best group from 2A) - Primary : Tumor growth delay, survival - Secondary : Toxicity, PAT imaging for boron mapping - Go/No-Go : ≥30% tumor reduction vs. standard BNCT, acceptable toxicity Priority 3: Adjuvant Optimization (Months 5-7, Conditional) Study 3A: Microbubble Optimization - Concentrations : 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5% v/v (Definity-equivalent) - Measurements : Boron uptake enhancement, cavitation monitoring (acoustic emissions) - Go/No-Go : ≥20% boron boost vs. base protocol Study 3B: HfO₂ Nanoparticle Testing - Doses : 0, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg HfO₂-NPs - Endpoints : Safety, efficacy in full protocol (survival, tumor burden) Study 3C: Niacinamide Pre-treatment (Low Priority) - Groups : IV niacinamide (500 mg/kg) 30 min pre-BPA vs. control - Trigger : Suboptimal boron binding in Study 2A Critical Measurements - Pharmacokinetics : Blood ¹⁰B (5-300 min post-injection), tissue distribution (tumor, brain, liver, kidney), half-life - Dosimetry : Neutron flux (gold foil monitoring), gamma dose, Gy-Eq calculation - Imaging : MRI (tumor volume), PAT (boron mapping), ultrasound (cavitation) - Safety : Daily weight, neurological scoring, terminal histology (H&E), blood chemistry Timeline & Decision Gates - Month 3 : Confirm 60s window viability (Study 1A). Proceed if ≥60% retention. - Month 5 : Validate triple combo efficacy/safety (Study 2B). Proceed if ≥30% improvement. - Month 7 : Optimize adjuvants (Study 3). Proceed to Phase 2 if ≥20% added benefit. Current Status (Dec 08, 2025) 1. Tumor
Model: GL261 orthotopic in C57BL/6 mice; low-passage cells from ATCC ordered (ETA Dec 15). 
2. Neutron Source: 8-hour slots reserved bi-weekly starting Jan 15, 2026, at UW-Madison Alphabeam facility. 
3. ICP-MS: 80% validated for ¹⁰B (LOD 0.1 µg/g); mouse tumor spikes pending.
 4. IACUC: Protocol submitted (RGN-2025-047); approval ETA Dec 20.
 5. Materials: BPA-fructose ordered (ETA Dec 18), microbubbles (USphere) arriving Dec 14, transducer quote pending (Dec 10). Immediate Actions
